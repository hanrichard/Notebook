### yaml
yaml is a JavaScript parser and stringifier for YAML, a human friendly data serialization standard. It supports both parsing and stringifying data using all versions of YAML, along with all common data schemas. As a particularly distinguishing feature, yaml fully supports reading and writing comments and blank lines in YAML documents.
