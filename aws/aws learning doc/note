### efs vs s3

- Amazon EFS provides high-performance, secure access for thousands of connections to a shared file system using a traditional file permissions model, file locking, and hierarchical directory structure via the NFSv4 protocol.
It allows you to simultaneously share files between multiple Amazon EC2 instances across multiple AZs, regions, VPCs, and accounts as well as on-premises servers via AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN.
This is ideal for your business applications that need to share a common data source. For application workloads with many instances accessing the same set of files, Amazon EFS provides strong data consistency helping to ensure that any file read will reflect the last write of the file.

- Amazon S3 does not support a hierarchical structure. Though you can create folders within buckets, these are actually just pointers to groups of objects. The structure is flat in Amazon S3. Also, the consistency model of Amazon S3 is read-after-write for PUTS of new objects, but only eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES. This does not support the requirement for strong consistency.
