COMPUTE
Ensure you are fully comfortable with the terms EC2 Family, Type, Size and generation. It’s not essential to remember them all, but understanding the concepts and the major differences is an advanced.

Understand what each family of instances is useful for in terms of workload types. A problem in a question could be a bad instance type selection - or it could be irrelevant.

You need a good understanding of the SPOT pricing model - benefits and downsides of the model. What type of work is it suited for and not suited for - i.e applications which can tolerate interruption.

For S3 encryption, understand for each (client-side encryption, SSE-C, SSE-S3, SSE-KMS) who manages the encryption/decryption process and who manages the keys. When would you use SSE-KMS vs SSE-S3 (Role separation)

EFS when should you use it ? Shared instance storage. For logs? Or cloud watch logs?

FSX - architecture, different file systems. The use cases for each. Windows systems feature more in SAA-C02 so FSx is more important vs SAA-C01.

Know what services an egress-only internet gateway provides and how they are configured.

DNS in a VPC .. public and private DNS what IPs are resolved?

SGs - features, limits, what are they attached too.. stateful

NACLs - features, limits, what are they attached too … explicit DENY & stateless.

You need to REALLY understand what an Ephemeral port is. Specifically know that an incoming tcp/80 stream of data has a return stream using ephemeral port range (not port 80!!) ..

How to secure a multi-tier application in a VPC … routes, NACL/SG

Know the common ports .. SSH, SQL, HTTP, HTTPS, RDP, SMTP, TELNET (it makes it easier to parse questions)

VPC Peering - limits and features, transitive (NOT). DNS resolution.

How does VPN work … IPSEC, Gateways, Authentication, IPs, Static v Dynamic.

Direct Connect, architecture, VIFs, public v private. Encryption over DX. Provisioning time vs VPN

Aurora serverless questions were mentioned around scaling back to 0 - understanding that its capable of running with 0 load - paused cluster

When to use a read replica .. including multi-AZ RR

Knowing what MultiAZ does, vs Read Replica - for HA, MultiAZ = availability, RR = read scaling and improved RPO/RTO

Know that RDS (non-aurora) can’t access the standby instance, Aurora can - what benefits does this provide ….

Using Reporting via a RR as the source is a great architecture

How to create an encrypted version of an existing database …

Diagnose bad DB performance … only at 60% CPU .. what is the cause ? Disk? Use a read replica?

Understand which DB’s in AWS are delivered as a service, vs a Database Server as a service.

How to achieve Global HA … S3 transfer acceleration, cross region replication, cloud front + S3

SQS vs Kinesis … there was a question about picking between the two. Be really sure on HOW to pick between. Make sure you are REALLY clear on this one, and ideally make it instinctive.
