- Itâ€™s hard to reuse stateful logic between components
- Complex components become hard to understand
- Classes confuse both people and machines

### useContext
```
const initState = useContext(context)
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initState)
```


```
import context from ....
const {dispatch} = userContext(context)

dispatch({type: "LOGIN_USER", payload: date})
```
