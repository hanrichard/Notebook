1- What is Next.js, and how is it different from React?
Next.js is a React-based open-source framework that helps developers build server-side rendered React applications.


The key difference between React and Next.js is the way they handle routing. React uses client-side routing, meaning the page transitions are handled entirely on the client-side using JavaScript.


In contrast, Next.js provides server-side routing, which means that the server handles the routing and sends the pre-rendered pages to the client, resulting in faster page loads and better SEO.

Next.js also provides additional features like automatic code splitting, static site generation, and dynamic imports.

2- What are the advantages of using Next.js over React?
Next.js offers several advantages over React, including server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, static site generation, dynamic imports, optimized performance, and easy deployment. Additionally, Next.js supports built-in SEO and analytics, making it easier to optimize your application for search engines and track user engagement.

3- How do you create a new Next.js application?
To create a new Next.js application, you can use the create-next-app command. For example, you can run the following command in your terminal: npx create-next-app my-app. This will create a new Next.js application with the name my-app.

4- What is server-side rendering, and why is it important?
Server-side rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering a web page on the server before sending it to the client's browser. SSR is important because it allows search engines to crawl and index your website's content, which can improve your website's SEO. Additionally, SSR can improve the initial page load time and improve the user experience for users with slow internet connections or devices.

5- What is client-side rendering, and how does it differ from server-side rendering?
Client-side rendering (CSR) is the process of rendering a web page on the client's browser using JavaScript after receiving the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the server. The key difference between SSR and CSR is that SSR sends a fully rendered HTML page to the client's browser, while CSR sends an empty HTML page that is populated by JavaScript.

6- What is static site generation, and how does it differ from server-side rendering?
Static site generation (SSG) is the process of generating a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file for each page on your website at build time. The key difference between SSG and SSR is that SSG generates a static file that can be served from a content delivery network (CDN), while SSR generates the HTML dynamically on the server and sends it to the client's browser.

7- How do you configure routing in a Next.js application?
Next.js uses file-based routing, which means that you can create a page by creating a new file in the pages directory with the corresponding URL path. For example, to create a page with the URL path /about, you would create a file called about.js in the pages directory.

8- What is the purpose of the getStaticProps function in Next.js?
The getStaticProps function is used to fetch data at build time for static site generation. This function is called during the build process and can be used to fetch data from an external API or database. The data returned by getStaticProps is then passed as props to the page component.

9- How do you pass data between pages in a Next.js application?
Next.js provides several ways to pass data between pages in a Next.js application, including URL query parameters, the Router API, and state management libraries like Redux or React Context. You can also use the getServerSideProps function to fetch data on the server and pass it as props to the page component.

10- How do you deploy a Next.js application?
Next.js applications can be deployed to a variety of platforms, including cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, as well as platforms like Vercel and Netlify. To deploy a Next.js application, you can use the next export command to export the static files for SSG or use a platform-specific deployment tool like Vercel's CLI or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

1- What is serverless architecture, and how does it relate to Next.js?
Serverless architecture is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically scales the resources based on demand. Next.js can be used with serverless architecture by deploying the application to a serverless platform like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.

2- What is the difference between getServerSideProps and getStaticProps functions in Next.js?
The getServerSideProps function is used to fetch data on the server at runtime for server-side rendering, while the getStaticProps function is used to fetch data at build time for static site generation.

3- What is the purpose of the getStaticPaths function in Next.js?
The getStaticPaths function is used to generate dynamic paths for pages with dynamic data. This function is called during the build process and can be used to generate a list of possible values for the dynamic data. The data returned by getStaticPaths is then used to generate static files for each possible value.

4- How do you configure dynamic routes in a Next.js application?
Next.js uses square brackets [] to denote dynamic segments in a URL path. For example, to create a dynamic route for blog posts with the URL path /blog/[slug], you would create a file called [slug].js in the pages/blog directory.

5- How does Next.js handle code splitting, and why is it important?
Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand when the user navigates to a new page. This helps to reduce the initial page load time and improve the performance of your application.

6- What is the purpose of the _app.js file in Next.js?
The _app.js file is used to wrap the entire application and provides global styles, layout components, and context providers. This file is called on every page request and can be used to add common functionality to your application.

7- How do you implement authentication in a Next.js application?
Next.js provides several options for implementing authentication, including JSON Web Tokens (JWT), OAuth, and third-party libraries like NextAuth.js. You can also use server-side rendering and session management to implement server-side authentication.

8- What is the difference between a container component and a presentational component?
A container component is responsible for managing the state and logic of a component, while a presentational component is responsible for rendering the UI based on the props passed down from the container component.

9- What is the purpose of the useEffect hook in React, and how does it relate to Next.js?
The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in a functional component, such as fetching data from an API or updating the document title. In Next.js, the useEffect hook can be used to

perform client-side data fetching using the fetch API or third-party libraries like Axios or SWR.

10- How do you handle errors in a Next.js application?
Next.js provides several options for error handling, including custom error pages, server-side error handling with getInitialProps, and client-side error handling with React error boundaries. You can also use third-party libraries like Sentry or Rollbar for error monitoring and reporting.
