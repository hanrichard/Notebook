- MLC React Design system (React UI kits) - we are using React (html5, es6, javascript, sass, style-component, etc) to build a page components library - navigation, buttons, accordion, hero, header, footer, etc..., (like the popular design system libraries, react material-ui, react bootstrap, etc...), to standardize same UI style across in different teams, and also, this is AA accessiblity tested library, as a results, we will always have consistant style page, including spacing, font, etc.

- and also, as a consumer, we are using components in the page component library to build pages (react, redux, etc), ideally drag and drop, and set up logical

#### build a form - page component library, set logic, by using react and redux, 
- React MLC pages - by using MLC Design system and using react/redux for business logics, and also using html5, SCSS, CSS-IN-JS, ES6

### Code review
- run it on local
- test functions - performance, improvement, like, use short syntax, how to define variables, naming convenstions, code simplify
- test unit test - coverage
- css/html
- Does the code work?
- Description of the project status is included.
- Code is easily understand.
- Code is written following the coding standarts/guidelines (React in our case).
- Code is in sync with existing code patterns/technologies.
- DRY. Is the same code duplicated more than twice?
- Can the code be easily tested (don't forget about React components)?
- Are functions/classes/components reasonably small (not too big)?
- Naming conventions followed for variables, file names, translations.
